Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It allows for modular, reusable, and organized code by modeling real-world entities as objects. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling efficient software design and maintenance.
